# BD Project

Group project for the BD (Databases) course unit.

The objective of the project was to create a database for a sports competition - in this case, the [Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores).

## Structure

* **BD_relatorio_final.pdf**: Project's report
* **Regulations/**: Documents with the Libertadores's regulations
* **criar.sql**: SQL commands used to create the database tables
* **povoar.sql**: SQL commands used to store data in the database tables
* **Queries/int\*.sql**: SQL queries that allow for database testing
* **Triggers/gatilho\*.sql**: SQL commands used to add, remove and/or test a trigger

***NOTE:*** The attributes of each class, alongside the project's report and SQL data, are all in Portuguese.
